## Average Color Calculator

Write a function that takes 2 colors as arguments and returns the average color.

1. The parameters will be two 6-digit hexadecimal strings. This does not need to be validated.
2. The return value should be a 6-digit hexadecimal string.
3. The hexadecimal strings represent colors in RGB, much like in CSS.
4. The average color is to be determined by taking the arithmetic mean for each component: red, green and blue.
